    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An artery clogging awful snack that no one should ever eating. Eating it is like being the parents from Spirited Away. Mad piggish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups cold butter, cut into tablespoon-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 stick of butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Toothpicks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk brown sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. Dip each piece of butter into cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat completely. Place butter pieces in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Freeze until hard, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Stir 1 cup flour, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat buttermilk, eggs, and white sugar together in another bowl; add flour mixture to buttermilk mixture and beat until smooth. Gradually stir remaining flour into buttermilk mixture until desired batter consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Most likely the hummus will be too thick or still have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, with the food processor turned on, slowly add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water until you reach the perfect consistency.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Poke a toothpick into the center of each frozen piece of butter. Dip butter into batter to coat completely.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, carefully drop coated butter pieces into hot oil and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown and puffed, about 2 minutes. Transfer fried butter to a paper-towel lined plate and dust with confectioners' sugar.</li>
    </ol>
